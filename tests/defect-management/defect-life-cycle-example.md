# Defect Life Cycle Example â€“ Postal Code Validation Bug

## Defect ID:
BUG-001

## Related Requirement:
FR09 - System must validate required fields during checkout

## Title:
System accepts invalid Postal Code during checkout

## Description:
During the checkout process, the system allows the user to proceed with an invalid Postal Code (more than 10 digits), which violates the validation requirement.

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login as a valid user (`standard_user` / `secret_sauce`)
2. Add any product to the cart
3. Go to cart and click "Checkout"
4. Enter valid First Name and Last Name
5. Enter an invalid Postal Code (e.g., `12345678901`)
6. Click "Continue"

## Expected Result:
The system should display an error message and prevent the user from proceeding.

## Actual Result:
The system allows the user to proceed to the next step with an invalid Postal Code.
